# RydeeNLP
## About
RydeeNLP is the capstone project for DS400, designed to assist Japanese language learners. This Chrome extension provides two main features:
  1.Translation
  2.Automated Flashcard Creation

## 1. Translation
The translation feature generates multiple Japanese translations based on the user's selected proficiency level (Elementary, Middle, or High school). 
Users can set their preferred level, allowing them to read Japanese texts that match their vocabulary skills.

## 2. Automated Flashcard Creation
Users can click on words in the generated translations that they are unfamiliar with or wish to remember. 
These words are automatically stored in the Anki flashcard app, eliminating the need for manual flashcard creation and helping users study Japanese more efficiently.
